This is an application that using spotify's (now annoyingly locked down) api to request an artists top 10 tracks using ES6's fetch() function. Artist information and top ten tracks are then displayed, and an option to play those track's samples is given.

NOTE: Spotify's API keys expire every 4 hours, so it will be necessary to generate a new API key every time you want to use this service. The neccessary files to do so are included in the /spotify-help folder.
